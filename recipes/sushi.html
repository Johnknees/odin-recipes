    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sushi rolls can be filled with any ingredients you choose. Your
      imagination is the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unleash your inner sushi chef with this simple yet exquisite homemade
      sushi recipe. Begin by preparing sushi rice to perfection, infused with a
      hint of rice vinegar for that authentic tang. Select the freshest
      ingredients for your fillings, such as succulent slices of salmon, crisp
      cucumber, and creamy avocado. Wrap these treasures in sheets of nori,
      rolling them tightly with a bamboo mat to ensure a compact, neat roll.
      Slice with precision to reveal the colorful layers of flavors. Serve with
      a side of soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger for the full sushi bar
      experience right at your dining table.

      <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been
        absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into
        cooked rice in the pot and set aside.

      <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>

      <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a
        thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado,
        cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.
      </li>

      <li>
        Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a
        complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
      </li>

      <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
